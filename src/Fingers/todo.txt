# Basics #

For each control type:

Given basic page HTML -> check correct UI is generated
Try preseting values -> check generated display
Test switching between read-mode and edit-mode
Edit value and cancel -> check UI resets
Edit value and save -> check UI updates

Common:
Clicking label starts edit
Escape -> Cancel edit
Enter -> Save edit
Blurring control in edit mode -> Save edit

# Controls #

Single text
    Basic interactions as above
    Simluate typing events

Multi text
    Tab between text boxes
    Insertion of new text box at end
    Focus on correct text box when beginning edit
    
Multi text with limit
    Similar to above
    Limit set in the original HTML element's class
    Number of text boxes in edit mode equals limit value

Boolean
    Use click event to check and uncheck

Select (one)
    Use jQuery to select value
    Behaviour for selecting the "empty" value?

Select (many)
    Use jQuery to select values
    Select none
    Select one
    Select many

Autocomplete
    Mock ajax call to return list of items

Multi autocomplete
    Enter none
    Enter one
    Enter many

Date picker
    Can we avoid testing jQuery UI too much? Since this should already work!
    Clicking a date on the calendar should finish editing
    Entering different date formats

CKEditor
    ??? this could be hard to test, given the nested ckeditor iframe.
    May need to come back to this...
